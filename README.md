## Introduction

The Sentiment Analyzer is a machine learning project designed to classify sentiments expressed in Twitter data as Positive, Neutral, or Negative. Utilizing a neural network architecture with Dense and Dropout layers, this application processes user input through a web interface and provides real-time sentiment predictions. Built using Flask, it aims to make sentiment analysis accessible and user-friendly.
